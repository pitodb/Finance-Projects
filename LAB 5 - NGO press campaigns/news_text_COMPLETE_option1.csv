In the letter, the indigenous communities claimed that DESA was responsible for the destruction of their territory, including land which has been cultivated for centuries, and had altered the natural course of the Gualcarque River. The community repeated their call for the construction of DESA's Agua Zarca hydroelectric dam to be halted, and for the bank to withdraw funding for the project and the company.

The NGOs also warned that the power plant may well be unprofitable from the outset, and will have disastrous environmental consequences, increase air pollution and involve the forced relocation of local citizens.

Ukraine's state-owned energy company Energoatom applied for the loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to upgrade its nuclear facilities, which activists claimed will extend the operational life of its nuclear power plants (NPP) beyond the current expiry date of 2020. To secure the EBRD loan, Ukrainian MPs must approve law No 0054, which will apparently act as a state-backed credit guarantee for the Energoatom project. The NGO claimed, however, that the supporting documents on the draft law do not contain all the relevant information and financial background of the project. It also claimed that the credit guarantee would be based on an increased energy tariff.<br /><em>SIGWATCH comment: In March 2013, CEE Bankwatch Network also raised objections to the EBRD loan (as previously reported by SIGWATCH).</em><br />See (in Ukrainian)",http://necu.org.ua/lyst-netsu-deputatam-vru-schodo-ratyfikatsiyi-harantiynoyi-uhody-mizh-ukrayinoyu-ta-ebrr-na-nadannya-300-milyonnoyi-pozyky-dp-naek-enerhoatom/#more-4130,http://necu.org.ua/wp-content/uploads/140110_vru.pdf,,,

AIDESEP had filed a formal petition last month, warning that the project violated the rights of indigenous peoples by failing to conduct prior consultation. The NGO had also argued that as planned, the project would inevitably result in conflicts between settlers and indigenous peoples, because a significant amount of land would inevitably be awarded to outsiders. AIDESEP called for the project to award property titles to indigenous communities first of all, including those 310 communities whose application for title is still pending.<br /><em>SIGWATCH comment: AIDESEP has been campaigning for greater recognition of indigenous rights in the PTRT land title project since Jan 2015 (as reported by SIGWATCH).</em><br />See (in Spanish)",http://www.aidesep.org.pe/bid-rectificara-el-ptrt3-en-respuesta-a-la-queja-presentada-por-aidesep/ ,,,,

Greenpeace claimed that over the past year, APRIL has destroyed an area of forest three times the size of Paris in Borneo, and the NGO repeated its demand that Santander urgently cut its financial support forthe timber and paper company. Greenpeace is also encouraging supporters to share the video as part of an ongoing campaign to stop Santander financing APRIL.<br />UPDATE (Feb 25) - According to media reports, Santander announced that it will not be extending further financing to Asia Pacific Resources International Limited (APRIL) due to evidence that the Singapore-based pulp and paper company is continuing to destroy rainforests in Indonesia. However, Santander didn't refer to the ongoing Greenpeace campaign in its decision, but claimed this was the result of its own audits and analysis.<br />See",http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/forests/new-footage-catches-april-destroying-rainforest-borneo-20150223,https://secure.greenpeace.org.uk/page/s/stop-financing-deforestation,http://news.mongabay.com/2015/0224-banco-santander-april.html,,

CONROA claimed that the mining concessions currently operating in the country threaten the environment and public health of hundreds of communities and have led to social conflicts and forced community migrations. CONROA also accused the government of failing to protect activists fighting to defend their communities, claiming it has instead protected the interests of international companies. The group cited a recent study which allegedly showed that the mining industry displaces other productive activities such as coffee farming, even though coffee farming reportedly creates more jobs, income, and better wealth distribution. Finally, CONROA criticized the authorities for failing to include public consultation on extractive projects ahead of the exploration phase, and the NGO demanded a full public debate on the future of the natural resources in the country.

The ENGO also claimed that the committee has withheld information about factors which may have contributed to the extinction of uncontacted indigenous people in Peru. The NGO argued that the Ethics Committee had recommended in 2010 that Repsol and Reliance Industries (both oil companies) be excluded from the fund, reportedly because their exploration in Peru rainforest could be fatal for uncontacted indigenous people who have low resistance to diseases from the developed world. The NGO also claimed, however, that the Norwegian Ministry of Finance had kept the information confidential for three years while oil exploration continued. Regnskogfondet also called for the immediate exclusion from the fund of other companies operating in isolated aboriginal habitats, including Canada's Pacific Rubiales Energy and US-registered Gran Tierra Energy (which also operate in Peru). Rainforest Foundation finally called for a six-month limit on the period for the fund manager, Norges Bank, to implement the Council's recommendations.

The comments came as Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages the Fund, released the Fund's annual report. FiVH also said a preliminary review indicated that the fund had reduced its relative investment in the oil and coal companies, but that three oil companies, Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil and BP, are still among the fund's largest equity holdings. It further criticized the fund's increased investments in H&M and Apple, citing allegations of poor working conditions at the companies. In addition, at the press conference presenting the results, Kirkens Nodhjelp and Changemakerdemonstrated in favor of greater investment by the Fund in developing countries. Separately, Greenpeace also welcomed the news that 11 palm oil producers had been dropped from the Fund, but said the choice of companies to drop appeared random, and that the Fund has given too much weight to membership in the Roundtable on Responsible Palm Oil (RSPO). Greenpeace claimed that membership in the RSPO certification scheme was insufficient to ensure responsible palm oil production.<br /><em>SIGWATCH comment: Companies dropped from the State Pension Fund because of their involvement in palm oil were Berjaya Corp Bhd Malaysia, Bollore France, Boustead Holdings Bhd Malaysia, First Resources Ltd Singapore, Genting Plantations Malaysia, Golden Agri-Resources Ltd Singapore, Indofood Agri Resources Ltd.

The consumer group apparently successfully argued that it was illegal for the bank to charge commissions on overdraft accounts. However, only a handful of the 104 customers who participated in the legal action were entitled to compensation, because only they had their contract signatures notarized. Altroconsumo insisted this was merely a bureaucratic nicety and advised all customers to simply go to the bank and demand their money back.

The financial watchdog argued that tax havens lack appropriate laws and regulations, thus leaving them open to being conduits for tax evasion, and that even Swedish legislation has significant gray areas.

GFI claimed that deferred prosecutions are failing to prevent such crimes, and that regulators had ordered HSBC in 2003 to improve its anti-money laundering controls.

DanWatch also claimed that the three banks did not regard food speculation as a problem, and that the issue was not included in their CSR policies nor do the banks inform customers that speculation could lead to food price increases and a decrease in food stocks.

Named organisations include some established social activist groups such as National People's Action, Allaince for a Just Society and PICO. But what is most interesting is Rainforest Action Network's attempt to broaden support for its environmental concerns by allying with the broader social movement against banks, just as other ENGOs have attempted to exploit the Occupy protests by sending their supporters into the camps. So far there is little sign that the strategy is helping to build support for the ENGOs - but it has given ammunition to critics of Occupy that the protestors do not share the real concerns of the 99%, like more jobs, that they claim to represent.</em> <br />See",http://ran.org/environmental-and-economic-justice-communities-target-bank-america%E2%80%A8%E2%80%A8,http://bankruptingamerica.tumblr.com/,,,

The environmental groups also urged KEXIM, Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and Japanese commercial banks not to provide funding for the two proposed supercritical coal-fired power plant units in Nghi Son Economic Zone in Tinh Gia district. They argued that the project conflicts with the UN Environmental Programme's Emissions Gap Report, which urges countries not to build new coal power plants and phase out existing coal power plants so as to meet the Paris climate goal. They also claimed that under OECD rules, the proposed supercritical technology is not eligible for export credit support.

Platform also demanded that EBRD refuse to fund the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) or any part of the BP-led Southern Gas Corridor project.

ViN argued that banks such as ING should use their influence to promote animal-friendly farming. The animal welfare group is additionally urging supporters to sign a petition demanding that Adriaan Straathof, who they claim was convicted of animal cruelty and other regulatory breaches relating to the fire, be banned from running any livestock factories in the Netherlands. A petition launched on Avaaz demanding local, national, and European regulators to suspend the license of Adriaan Straathof has apparently gathered more than 670,000 signatures.See (in Dutch and English)",https://www.varkensinnood.nl/nieuwsartikelen/ing-financiert-in-opspraak-geraakte-varkensboer-straathof,https://www.varkensinnood.nl/beroepsverbod-straathof,https://secure.avaaz.org/campaign/en/stop_pig_farm_torture_loc/,,

The eco group also claimed that the bank's latest lending policy does not appear to apply to parent companies of palm oil subsidiaries, and that there is no requirement for palm oil clients to agree to being named so they can be monitored.<br /><em>SIGWATCH comment: As flagged up earlier this year, Greenpeace is putting pressure on Standard Chartered Bank to tighten up its policies on palm oil lending now that HSBC has made a commitment that meets with Greenpeace's approval.</em><br />See",https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/standard-chartered-fails-to-protect-forests/,,,,

Banks whose portfolios were analyzed included Caixa Economica Federal, Itau Unibanco, Santander Brazil, Banorte, Citibanamex, Trust Funds for Rural Development (FIRA), Citigroup, UBS and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC).

The Polish environmental group claimed that the while the investment proposal is still under environmental impact review by the Mayor of Zakopane, a similar proposal had been raised before and decided against in 2006. It claimed the previous decision had ruled that the walking trails around Kasprowy Wierch would not be capable of handling the extra traffic, and it argued that nothing had changed since then to alter that conclusion.

The groups maintained that banks can, on occasion, contribute to human rights violations when providing financial products and services, and when these do occur their impact is significant.<br /><em>SIGWATCH comment: The Thun Group is an informal network of leading banks that since 2011 have been working together to apply the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights to banking.
